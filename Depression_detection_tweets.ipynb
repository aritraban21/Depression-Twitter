       "'The lack of this understanding is a small but significant part of what causes anxiety & depression to both feel so incredibly lonely. It\\'s soooo easy to compare. It\\'s so easy to invalidate ourselves because of that. i just told my parents about my depression and it\\'s so hard to get gen x people to understand that this is not something that i can control all the time or just cure with a walk or by keeping my mind busy depression is something i don\\'t speak about even going through it because it\\'s also such a double edged sword. i love every race. even if white people had done so much i can\\'t hate them all. my grandma is legit white! how tf can i hate, i do dislike people though. Made myself a tortilla filled with pb&j. My depression is cured.

Why does a burnout and occasional depression get you before the end of semester? I think I would know what depression is. And quite rarely do I slump into a paralyzed state where I want to be in a dark room away from anybody else. But every few weeks or so, I would wake up in the morning and nothing seems right. @QinniArt This kinda reminds me of when o was suffering from depression and after I got help I decided to chop off my hair.. there\\'s a study on people who suffer a dramatic event often chose to get a dramatic hair change after to recover @LieyaLutionary Not that he\\'s right but a lotta people who deal with depression find it hard to come to terms with it.. @Razer Depression @ColtonThomas01 I have both!
