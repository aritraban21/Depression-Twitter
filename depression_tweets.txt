great Interview depression in males is real I had a friend who suffered but was ashamed to ask for help sadly he took his own lifeüò¢üò¢
I say "doubt" bc even as a freaking person who suffers from it, I hate saying depression. Hate I feel ive to apologize for any contact.
im depression

Very hard episode to watch this evening üò™ #eastenders #depression #mentalhealth
I wonder what the people who lived through the great depression and two world wars would said to you pussies saying  2016 is the worst year
it is but it literally doesnt compare. one leads to depression, shame, and eating disorders far faaar more than the other.
seasonal depression is real lol. I hibernate
Leave my crippling depression in 2016
like when u have depression u just dont care for ur appearance at all so u just look like shit all the time cos u dont care
I know what depression is like, because i have suffered from it, i know it effects every man and women different #eastenders
2016 has brought so many important storylines. Including stacey's postpartum psychosis, peggy's death, Paul's death, Lee's depression 1/2
Believe me, if someone wants to cover up depression they really can. The whole reason why people don't confide in anyone is....
hmm something against during-c3 depression would be good...
@danboy can i just virtually give you a huge hug please you incredible human being...such a beautifully truthful portrayal of depression x
@danboy can i just virtually give you a huge hug please you incredible human being...such a beautifully truthful portrayal of depression x
Well done @bbceastenders tonight the best episode in ages love that depression and self harming are being highlighted in a great way
I now openly admit my depression, I'm not ashamed & don't care what others think. If they think less of me, that's their problem.
When people go around saying they have depression when they haven't even been diagnosed by a professional. üëå
Well done @danboy, powerful scenes. Great acting, especially with this depression storyline! #Eastenders üëè
Nothing I just don't think her music is appropriate for kids that young. She sings about doing drugs, depression, and loneliness.
a nice thought a day keeps depression away. Thanks a lot! I really had a fun time hanging with you guys back in Japan (1/2)
A bot must recognize the symptoms of depression in your spouse. A bot must think about your life. A bot must be aware of emerging science.
Im glad you did man! Genuinely. For me I made career strides, but also  got divorced, suffered anxiety and depression etc -
Tonight was powerful. First Lee's depression then finding out Max is self-harming...Such a huge shock. Well done #EastEnders for tackling üëèüèæ
its very... notable that whenever I make characters or stories, I can't do so without depression and poorness being part of their identity
So good to see #EastEnders tackle depression in a young man brilliant acting too
certain distress or depression or other mental illness because they present a safe place to confront those things. A world where
Huge well done to @danboy and Sally Rogers for tonight's @bbceastenders from somebody with depression - perfect portrayal of living with it!
Hey depression excuse me but why
2 car accidents. A madea bubble built bitch took my mans. depression. fake ass friends.
We are every impressed by the way #eastenders has handled the topic of depression this year. üíî #MentalHealthMatters Thank you @danboy
I've just slept for almost 12 hours 2 days in a row. This is the 4th day I haven't left my house. I want to feel normal again. #depression
People who suffer from depression aren't thinking rationally so they see absolutely no other way out
Hope @danboy is nominated for an award at next years BSA's he has been phenomenal during Lee's depression storylineüôåüëè #MentalHealthMatters
he was brilliant great portrayel of depression had me crying as i suffer myself & been suicidal üëèüëèüëè‚ò∫‚ò∫
go faire une depression
depression cherry
Great scenes tonight @danboy, you've portrayed this depression storyline very well! #Eastenders
Not having enough sex can put you at risk of anxiety paranoia and depression.
I guess not, once again she said that I obviously don't know what real depression is
Cops with depression
the depression is stronk today :') I have a lot of pre work anxiety
Im going through some meat depression right now
c-clinical depression?
Zero in more on the shogi matches and Rei's depression. Fewer slice-of-life cooking shenanigans from other characters.
Eastenders doing a lot of  justice regarding depression and mental health in men .
'Father.' He really was upset with himself for letting Bruce's depression get this far.
I suffered from pneumonia and it wasnt half as crippling as when I've been at my worst with depression. #Eastenders did a great job tonight.
Optimist people are not just cheerful people, they have better relationships and have to deal with less anxiety, stress & depression.
will have taught people that people with depression r not faking it for attention or anything ridiculous like that but they're ill
Some advice would be helpful... Or some clarification - am I suffering from depression?
you actually described why ppl move from serious anxiety episodes to extreme depression. Survival response.
I pressed shuffle and Marilyn Monroe comes on, made my fucking day and saved me from depression
If your suffering with depression don't watch @bbceastenders #eastenders is the most depressing soap on tv!
yes me too! And Lee with his depression. Shows it can happen to anyone and most importantly, not just women!!
absolutely sobbing that eastenders is tackling depression and self-harm with men
$600 fix to my car üòîdepression mode activated
I struggled with a lot of depression and anxiety this semester so I'm proud of my 3.1 GPA!
Well done #EastEnders for bringing depression/ mental health into public eye. A realistic, well acted story that will hopefully help someone
make depression your prisoner. Don't let it be your master
When you slip back into depression, and can't find a ladder to climb back out
Thanks for making me forget about my depression and anxiety for a few minutes everyday. Love your videos! Keep doing good!üíö
Brill portrayal into showing how hard it is to live with #depression brought a tear too my eye as I know that feeling to well @bbceastenders
well done to Eastenders for doing a story on depression, especially in men, ppl suffer & hide it, the best way is honestly talking about it
Linked a few people that suffer from depression this year & I realised its not a joke or a fake illness
As someone who has depression it really upsets me when uneducated people write nasty comments mental health. Hopefully @danboy doing this...
After watching #eastenders i now have depression ‚òπÔ∏è
there was a helpline number for depression afterwards-I'm not sure if that is normal with the programme but Christ it's depressing
I find interesting that you feel the need to claim the whole world is angry to control your depression. Get over it. She lost. He won.
yes it does, I struggled with depression and anxiety and still do now after massive break down üëé #MentalHealthMatters
Hard viewing that eastenders tonight!! #depression
just got diagnosed ! i have clinical depression üòúüëä
Reminder: telling people with anxiety and depression that it's "all in your head" is like telling an asthmatic it's "all in your lungs".
Well done to #Eastenders on their #depression storyline üëèüëèüëè
Wow, another worthy episode. A real feeling episode.  So many issues all linked with depression. But a positive end #hope ‚ú®
the worst of them being my depression and knee disorder
.zy do they call it a happy meal if it tastes like a wh|le lot like depression.
Poor Lee. Acting aside, mental health is something that needs to be spoken about more. Especially male depression. #Eastenders #MentalHealth
amazingly well by @danboy he should be so proud! I'm genuinely moved I've got aniexty + depression and its shit :) x #MentalHealthMatters
The depression symptoms have stopped but now the anxiety symptoms are kicking in!
Brilliant scenes tonight @danboy @bbceastenders I really hope they change some people's opinions about depression
When oddly melancholic music plays at the end of Eastenders...üò¢ #addiction #alcoholism #depression all in @BBCOne @bbceastenders tonight
Well done #EastEnders for tackling a really important subject - depression in men. Really moving performance from @danboy - great job üëè
Favorite travel games in 2016: Is it jetlag or depression? And Is it jetlag or anxiety/insomnia?
thanks. I feel like it's not coming back though, my depression passed about 2 weeks ago and I still don't care
well done for highlighting male depression, very well done indeed üòê
I'd like to argue that attractive men with puppies could cure depression
depression is a real mental health üôÑ obviously and yes he is a strong actor
90s cartoons and crippling depression.
RT "RT Parveen_Comms: Anyone suffering from depression should get help. I know it's easy for me to say, but there are people out there who ‚Ä¶
Really impressed with Eastenders trying to bring attention to male depression. Over 70% of suicides in the UK are male, it's unacceptable.
Your crippling depression is showing
Absolutely amazing performance by @danboy tonight on #Eastenders shining a light on the powerful issue of men's depression. Fantastic sir!
So glad @bbceastenders didn't kill Lee off but instead gave his character the strength to seek help for his depression. Amazing ep! @danboy
Thought Eastenders was brilliant- Mental illness/depression is such an awful thing and hopefully people's eyes have been opened #eastenders
Well done to #eastenders for the very powerful depression storyline. Great acting! Please talk things out guys-#itsoktotalk
Guess what time is it? Its depression o'clock
Credit eight years of sound economic policies -from depression to a roaring end. Now we must face a Hoover on steroids. Bad end.
i LOVE depression ! my BEST friend
Poor Lee. Acting aside, ALL mental health needs to be spoken about more. Especially male depression. #eastenders #speakout #mentalhealth
Eastenders don't half know how to get that seasonal depression in motion
I have crypling depression
Yes I am feeling emotionally destressed after that overload of depression. Do they do it to make us realise how fortunate we are? #enders
i feel really ill      in like a panickihg depression way ??????
time to try to make my depression go away by sleeping in the middle of the day!!! it's never worked before but another try can't hurt!!
my hopes for my depression disentergrating like my will for existance.
Post-con depression pls.
.@thebandGHOST both cured and caused my depression
Gratitude reduces the risk of anxiety & depression. #iammentallyaware #iambipolar
Place always looks a little bare & lonely after Christmas. Wonder if the stats on depression increase after Christmas?
I'm glad Lee's 'young male' depression storyline finally went somewhere past the audience hating him. This topic deserved better #EastEnders
Nothing makes me forget about my depression more than watching @Zak_Bagans honestly makes me believe in the unbelievable üëäanythings possible
the only threesome i've ever had was with anxiety and depression
I just saw a road sign that said debt and depression real big and i though i was about college
@danboy Don't think I've ever seen depression so accurately and beautifully depicted. Moving beyond words.

Holy shit. My depression just like sky rocketed for no reason?????? Sweet. Love it.
#leecarter in #eastenders got me crying at his acting. Well done @danboy for your take on depression and how isolating it can be üëèüèª
Very powerful episode of @bbceastenders tonight, great performance by @danboy #eastenders #depression #awareness #SalvationArmy
me: sleeps 14-16 hours/day my depression: "bitch, thought you'd seen the last of me"
Some days my bed wins and I'm ok with it #chronicpain #depression
Great performance from 'Lee on tonight's #eastenders portraying a man at the edge of his depression.
my belief in #projectlg have been a life guard for two friends going through depression while battling my own we can beat this
Just been told I don't understand depression.Why judge me?? You don't know I had 3 breakdowns in the 80's.. TOSSER!! #eastenders
Would be lovely if depression could 'just end' it's an important storyline about a serious issue
@bbceastenders really sensitive portrail of depression so many young men stay silent out of fear of not being "real" men #dontbesilent
Depression is not a 'bit of a slump' after an extended period of joy, depression doesn't come with the joy. Be smarter.
Well done @bbceastenders on depression storyline. Very well handled, shame @danboy is leaving. has done a great job
Very emotional episode of Eastenders.watching lee carter suffering from depression good acting from tfe actor who plays him
Wow @bbceastenders did an amazing job on telling the story of male depression & #mentalhealth well done #Eastenders
I don't have anxiety. I don't have depression. I'm just really sad.
I gave up on my diet after 3 days and honestly I'm not even ashamed of myself.  Y'all crazy for eating the epitome of depression on a plate.
#Eastenders is phenomenal tonight. Moved me to tears. Raising awareness of mental health & depression is so important. Well done @danboy üëèüèª
U know it's super hard for someone to open up about having depression or anxiety
I will leave you to your cesspool of depression and despair. üòò
#eastenders  brilliant storyline about male depression. Hopefully it'll help some guys stop suffering in silence. Well done all üëç
Them: "I'm sorry you have [OCD], but depression is worse."  Me: *nods politely, refrains from mentioning the psych hold*
Thank God for yoga. Yoga has helped so much with depression and anxiety.
Wait, was the picture of the boy Karen's son?! And maybe he had depression? üò≠üò≠ #EastEnders
but wow. By now it's anything but a joke. I'm completely invested in it and it dragged me out of a half year long depression
I've actual hut depression without my phone
Trying so hard not to enter depression but nothing is going right for me right now

@danboy fantastic portrayal of depression and why mental health is so so important.
aww you got mad üòç I'm here for you in case you get a crippling depression from al bab
Hey there I'm in this new band called JINX the demo is done and will be out very soon. FFO: Irish whiskey and depression/anxiety stay tuned
Damian watched Tim disappear down the driveway. He felt the dark void of guilt and depression set in. @RedRobin_3
Props to the scriptwriters too. Nuanced, sensitive portrayal of depression x poverty x toxic gender roles. #Eastenders
My depression and anxiety understand that when we have political differences but they can't really get, "Yeah, I just don't like her."
Outstanding acting from @danboy tonight, as a depression sufferer it's being played out perfectly in my eyesüëÄ‚ù§
@danboy Amazing acting showing depression can be harmful and hurt people.
Poor lee breaking my heartüò¢depression is a serious illness and @danboy and @bbceastenders have done it so well
I would come on, but I'm in bed with crippling depression
depression cherry is such a good album!!!!
'2016 was the worst year ever'  WW1, WW2, The great depression.  I can carry on...?
glad he didn't jump, the car park lady would need therapy after that.  Well done Eastenders for covering #suicide #depression
Massive respect to @danboy for doing such a great job on this very important storyline about depression and male suicide #EastEnders
My parents both suffered from depression. After I was born.
Lee storyline shows how depression can build and the resultant thoughts completely cloud reality. #eastenders
I'm almost caught up with part 8, and I'm pretty sure that once I am I'll just slip into unrelenting depression.
Lee is absolutely breaking my heart omg, this is so sad to watch, I don't think people realise how much depression affects and takes over
Going through severe depression last year was probably one of the best things that could have happened to me. It woke me up. (cont.)
i may suffer from "anxiety" and "Depression" but i'm still a queen
This is how suicide, depression, dropping out of school and permanent damage to someone's life happens.
god forbid you have to deal with depression one day & your doctor snores on you. Hun.
For all the people tweeting 'jump you cunt' to Lee, I really pray you don't suffer from depression you evil shits.  üò° #eastenders
Some first rate scriptwriting in #eastenders for once. Highlighting depression in young men. Well done lads  at the @BBC
I find watching stuff when someone shows depression and suicide hard , it personally hits me @danboy portrays it all brilliantly üôåüèª
I'd say well done to @bbceastenders for tackling male depression/suicide. Lee's storyline is reality for many men. #EastEnders
As someone who has has and does suffer with depression I can say people who have not suffered with it will never fully understand it.
"Mess"?You mean how he brought us back from the brink of economic depression?The man kicked ass.
#EASTENDERS That was amazing-as someone who has suffered from depression it portryed it perfectly. If only there was someone there for evey1
mitsuchizu is your worst kind of depression because the mao figure OwO but u gotta trust me w ur addresso
As someone who's been there, done that and got the depression postcard, I wasn't convinced. 'Karen' read a Samaritans guidebook. #EastEnders
People judge too easy. You dont understand depression then just be quiet. Dont be mean about it #eastenders
#eastenders How sad for Lee. I'd like to see the 'man up' and 'jump' brigade go through depression, might change their opinion.
The amount of people on Twitter who think Lee's depression and suicide is a laughing matter shock me. #EastEnders
Well done to #eastenders for how they're handling Lee's depression and suicide storyline üíù
#eastenders Am in bits over Lee's storyline about depression, amazing acting and very hard hitting. @danboy can't praise you enough for it.
#eastenders  highlighting depression in today's episode. Poor Lee.
#Eastenders is extremely emotional tonight. Poor Lee suffering from depression, affects so many people every single day! @bbceastenders
To be fair, I don't really think the issue of male depression/suicide is unrealistic
deleting my tumblr & moving out of my hometown cured my depression
Danny Boy Hatchard's acting is off the scale tonight! I'm crying along with Lee! üò¢ #Eastenders have done an amazing portrayal of depression.
well 1929 started the great depression of America sure that doesnt compare to the Great Bitching of America 2016
Sobbing my eyes out at #eastenders depression is a horrible thing for anyone to go through,heartbreaking feeling that you're all alone üíîüò•üíî
she's being treated different because of her "depression" and she refuses to do any press
@danboy deserves a freckin' oscar right now..!!!!!!! Amazing portrayal of depression & how it affects people üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
Hearts breaking for Lee on Eastendersüíî This is why mental health needs to be maken more seriously, depression can kill.
Such a good story line for Lee #eastenders #depression
Fair play to #EastEnders tackling the issue of depression in young men, it really isn't talked about enough.
Depression is telling me quit job heal self anxiety is telling me no bitch u could never go thru another job interview ever again
Lee Carter's performance was heartbreaking. Shows how depression can affect anyone, even those from 'perfect' families. #eastenders
Yes because when I'm blonde it shows my crippling depression
EastEnders depression storyline is important but I can't take a straight white man saying he wishes he was gay because it would be easier? üôà
Poweful stuff tonite. Hope it opens people eyes to depression and how painful it can be.  #eastenders
@danboy is doing a shit job of portraying someone with depression. Coming across a lot more like a complete wet flannel. #eastenders
Respect to #eastenders for recognising depression in a normal working class male. Been there, lost 'friends'.  Difficult to watch.
Living in a psuedo-depression made up of memes doesn't sound too bad...
I understand depression and mental illness i have battled mental health issues, this lee stuff is awfully done #eastenders
writing mitsuchizu was the worst kind of depression because the mao figure is sold out
*has crippling depression and tries to lighten it up by streaming
don't like #Eastenders I can partly relate to this depression story, Hard to fit in anywhere if your starting from scratch like I've had to.
Like I'm glad none of my friends actually got depression cause they probably would've took they own life listening to the rest of the group
This script is a bit clunky. "Yes depression is a big problem among young men, Lee, that's why we're doing this storyline." #eastenders
Fair play to eastenders for highlighting depression in men
depression
I don't want to work... ahhh. Ugh.... let me sleep for a few years.. depression is.. taking me... nooooooo
Omg depression is awful. And feeling like there's no way out. I've been there. Come on Lee, .. @bbceastenders this is so hard to watch  üò≠üò≠üò≠
But depression is the reality? What do
Thing is I wish #eastenders focused more on the developments of Lee's depression to make more people aware of the issues that come with it
#FF @JoEllenNotte for interesting posts about #sex #depression #sextoys & more!
@bbceastenders scariest thing in the world is your loved one suffering from depression thanks for this storyline
(2/2) Get better. I had depression and anxiety myself. It is zero fun. But it does make us stronger, but I hope you best.
Alot of you are so heartless  If someone close to you suffers from depression you gonna go tell them to jump aswell?  #eastenders
@danboy acting is amazing in #eastenders depression is a horrible thing, and he is playing this amazingly üôåüèº
Well done @bbceastenders on tackling depression and suicide in men. Needs to be talked about more.
Leave that idea that anxiety and depression can be easily controlled! Leave that idea with all the other bs ideas in 2016
Now it turns out to be described in a series of tall depression?
The issue with eastenders is they make a proper storyline like depression and have to throw in the stealing bullshit #eastenders
Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression
This is how bad depression can be and killing your self is not the answer. Think of your family and friends!  #eastenders
What a job Eastenders are doing on this depression storyline. Still a huge stigma around mental illness in men and we must talk about that.
Hats off to @bbceastenders and @danboy for their amazing story line and acting covering depression!
Well done @bbceastenders on such a moving and accurate portrayal of depression
It took depression to open my eyes
People saying lee should man up & stop self pitying ffs depression is a real thing & DOES happen to men, it's a serious illness #EastEnders
@danboy I suffer from depression and you are capturing it so well xx
My Heart's breaking for Lee. I know what depression is like @bbceastenders #eastenders
How was Lee in the army? I know depression can do A LOT but his character is so generally weak.   #EastEnders
@bbceastenders touching scenes on the roof top. Really well done and touched me. Well done @danboy great job showing how tough depression is
Keep poisoning your mind with negative thoughts then wonder why your depression doesnt go away #SumPeepulTwoStoopid
it is good that they are raising awareness of depression in men!
I wish Eastenders just focused on Lee's depression rather than turning him into a criminal
The woman with Lee is doing a brilliant job with supporting him through his depression #EastEnders
Tbh I can relate to what Lee is saying, depression is horrible :( #eastenders
ure gonna get depression if u don accept reality üòâ
@danboy bringing so much awareness to depression in #EastEnders it's heartbreaking, if it only helps one person that's a breakthrough!
he's got depression? It doesn't work like that lol dick
This ep of @bbceastenders is heartbreaking üíîbut so good. Shows the real side of depression and super stuff @danboy
ppl are fucking disgusting tweeting "jump" i pray to god your family/friends never come to you about depression. #EastEnders
ure gonna get depression if u don accpet reality üòâ
the storyline on easterners about lee's depression has me in tears
You know, I'd feel for Lee if he wasn't incredibly unlikable. I have clinical depression, I don't steal from my family #eastenders
what does anxiety + depression feel like
Wonderful performance by @danboy depression and suicide in young men is often ignored well done to @bbceastenders for this storyline. ‚ù§
Lee mate let me tell you first hand being gay doesn't make crippling depression easier to deal with #eastenders
The "my love life sucks" NYE depression is starting to hit me pretty hard. I had hopes I could avoid this.
Am I just lazy or is my depression causing me to be constantly tired and unmotivated: the saga
if they had auctually focused on Lee just with his depression this story would have worked. turning him into a criminal didint #eastenders
My father is in depression. [As far as I can think of
obsessed with my depression
Well done #eastenders for this depression story.
When some people had a good -personal- 2016 and all that happened for me was more depression üôÉ

Carrie Fisher was the first person to make me feel it was ok to be someone who suffered from depression and not be ashamed.
I went into a 4 month depression because of that fucking show. Hundreds of queer youth went into depression because of what Jason & t100 did
#eastenders so powerful and relatable #depression Well portrayed how you can spiral
spiral into the worse depression so far down it'll be hard to come back
There's limits to everything and I don't take depression lightly.
why isnt it socially acceptable for ppl with depression to go to bed whenever they want without their family questioning them
