Yes, I can confirm that a deep depression interspersed with anxiety and the occasional sense of worthlessness is the way to go.
My circle hit a major depression lol but you know whose for you in the end
Well done @danboy for your portrayal of Lee and his depression. Tonight's ep hit home a lot. Such an important message #MentalHealthMatters
Also, to avoid some certain depression, I will be off from twitter for a while. But I will still be on Telegram though!
december = depression 💔
Depression and suicide as a whole is a sensitive topic but we just assume that generally females are more susceptible. That's wrong.
i love turning my despair and depression into fake gold stars, here online the digital web
I've been MIA for 4 days bc I was in a mental hospital for depression & suicidal tendencies. I'm okay now in case anyone was wondering

Well done #EastEnders cast and crew for the stunning portrayal of depression and suicidal thoughts.

Idk if it's stress or depression
era, ww1&2, the great depression years, the 70s, etc those headlines calling it the "worst year" is just click bait.
Being in the same rotten looking place for a long time might be a big factor in your situational depression, aside from no friends & no sex.
I hate going back & reading how detailed & intense my fandom shit was when I was 13 its a constant reminder of how depression nerfed me
Eastenders are doing a fantastic job with raising awareness for things...transplant storyline and depression storyline definitely subjects
the "natsume didnt came home" squad may not have the 5* But we got crippling depression, the will to die and cookies
to be happy, and to love myself, and to try to defeat my depression
Having depression is like being in an abusive relationship with yourself...
#MassageTherapy has been shown to relieve depression, especially in people who have chronic fatigue syndrome.
depression is when you don’t really care about anything. anxiety is when you care too much, and over think everything, having both is hell
depression and anxiety currently holding me back
I seal myself away in the depression orb
I have crippling depression

Sleeping next to someone you love not only reduces depression, but it also helps you to live longer and makes you fall asleep faster.

Watching eastenders, I'm so moved by @danboy and his portrayal of lee, too many people don't have the chance to talk about their depression😔
PTSD is a very under recognized thing and it makes me sad that people think depression is just something they can turn on and off
@superlativelyLJ My partner had depression this year and it was the hardest thing we have ever done. Your openness is amazing!

I've sadly realized I can't empathize with people who find being suicidal or suicide as an abnormal/concerning thing or depression; cripplin
Have you lived with someone who has depression
never has so much expectation being crushed so quickly, I felt a great depression in the force
Blubbing away @bbceastenders depression and debt are the devil on my shoulder also, bit worse than Lee but well done @danboy #thisisreal
Nearly sobbing at #eastenders 😢 what a deep dark hole he is in I hope Lee finds a way out 🙏🏽 that goes for others with depression🙅🏼💔
#JusticeForHenryLau Henry is smiling at the Camera but deep down he's battling a depression, far from his family
I thought depression isn't my thing but what happen last night I really just want to cry.

@landylandy wot an absolute knob! lee carter storyline is bein played excellently. speaking from some1 who suffers depression
What a performance tonight by @danboy I actually had tears in my eyes a very moving episode #eastenders #leecarter #depression
#JusticeForHenryLau just how bad has @SMTOWNGLOBAL gone for their artist to ask for help already? from his post I can sense his depression

@megarush1024 The great depression happened next
crippling depression
if my man is even half as loyal to me as my anxiety and depression are we'll be okay
Death in my family put a tremendous strain on every ounce of my being, and I already suffered from depression and anxiety. Not cool to say
Well done in tackling depression & self harm, especially in males, in such a sensitive & honest way. #endthestigma 👏💔
I was left pretty heartbroken, have continued my battle with severe depression/anxiety, & realized there's a lot that's toxic in my life.
beyond moving to watch. My husband suffers from depression and you did him and others who do justice.
Half the world is in depression. The other half has large asset bubbles. High energy prices aren't coming any 1/
I was in a rampage, dwell in my lonesome, talking to the ears of no one, dwell in deep depression...
but you know that depression is going to fight tooth and nail to make you self destructive.
I have fallen into a deep depression because my cat tortures my dog, eats all of our food, and destroys our home.
this is shocking. Let's hope you never suffer with depression!
Tricky one though. Personally, I'd rather important issues like depression be discussed than swept under the carpet.
i have to sulk into a winter depression of trap music life live al lthe tway
@danboy The Story line currently with depression and suicide is so important. It's difficult to understand if you haven't been through it
when my depression is rly bad ill take 2 naps a day & thats def not ideal but....i should be nicer to myself. gonna go get french fries now
I love Job. It really helped me through depression. It expressed what I felt. Same w/ Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Psalms,Proverbs
Eastenders is handling Lee's depression story so well , hopefully it helps more people see what it's like living with a mental illness
crippling depression?
most realistic portrayal I have seen of depression I suffer depression & been on brink of suicide I agree he deserves award xx
To all the people that showed me love,  helped my depression and saw past my walls this year, thank you. I know dealing with me is hard.🙁
my life has improved exponentially ever since i got my computer and can distract myself from crippling depression and the doom of the world
I believe I am beginning to lose my battle with depression as I honestly feel like sleeping my life away again much as i did a full year ago
Can they make a weed without the depression please thank you
The significance of this dilemma is met by the remark that carries the depression?
bc depression is a bitch. You're alive & that's more than enough justification.
bah. I know depression is very hard to fight but I don't care. Listen to the people telling you that you are worth it.
Navigating post partum depression, And It's There To Stay
@danboy absolutely brilliant performance tonight.suffering with depression myself I could really relate.#MentalHealthMatters
Haven't gotten out of bed earlier than 1pm all week. Some call that depression. I call it HELLL YEAH CHEERS TO WINTER BREAK MOFOS!!!
But I relate to Lee's storyline so much and it means the world to see depression being portrayed so amazingly #EastEnders #SuicideAwareness
@LeafyIsHere your videos remove my crippling depression
"Depression isn’t a straightforward response to a bad situation; depression just is, like the weather."
I need to go for a run when I get home. That depression I've staved off is up and heading toward me at a rapid clip.
great Interview depression in males is real I had a friend who suffered but was ashamed to ask for help sadly he took his own life😢😢
I say "doubt" bc even as a freaking person who suffers from it, I hate saying depression. Hate I feel ive to apologize for any contact.
im depression

Very hard episode to watch this evening 😪 #eastenders #depression #mentalhealth
I wonder what the people who lived through the great depression and two world wars would said to you pussies saying  2016 is the worst year
it is but it literally doesnt compare. one leads to depression, shame, and eating disorders far faaar more than the other.
seasonal depression is real lol. I hibernate
Leave my crippling depression in 2016
like when u have depression u just dont care for ur appearance at all so u just look like shit all the time cos u dont care
I know what depression is like, because i have suffered from it, i know it effects every man and women different #eastenders
2016 has brought so many important storylines. Including stacey's postpartum psychosis, peggy's death, Paul's death, Lee's depression 1/2
Believe me, if someone wants to cover up depression they really can. The whole reason why people don't confide in anyone is....
hmm something against during-c3 depression would be good...
@danboy can i just virtually give you a huge hug please you incredible human being...such a beautifully truthful portrayal of depression x
@danboy can i just virtually give you a huge hug please you incredible human being...such a beautifully truthful portrayal of depression x
Well done @bbceastenders tonight the best episode in ages love that depression and self harming are being highlighted in a great way
I now openly admit my depression, I'm not ashamed & don't care what others think. If they think less of me, that's their problem.
When people go around saying they have depression when they haven't even been diagnosed by a professional. 👌
Well done @danboy, powerful scenes. Great acting, especially with this depression storyline! #Eastenders 👏
Nothing I just don't think her music is appropriate for kids that young. She sings about doing drugs, depression, and loneliness.
a nice thought a day keeps depression away. Thanks a lot! I really had a fun time hanging with you guys back in Japan (1/2)
A bot must recognize the symptoms of depression in your spouse. A bot must think about your life. A bot must be aware of emerging science.
Im glad you did man! Genuinely. For me I made career strides, but also  got divorced, suffered anxiety and depression etc -
Tonight was powerful. First Lee's depression then finding out Max is self-harming...Such a huge shock. Well done #EastEnders for tackling 👏🏾
its very... notable that whenever I make characters or stories, I can't do so without depression and poorness being part of their identity
So good to see #EastEnders tackle depression in a young man brilliant acting too
certain distress or depression or other mental illness because they present a safe place to confront those things. A world where
Huge well done to @danboy and Sally Rogers for tonight's @bbceastenders from somebody with depression - perfect portrayal of living with it!
Hey depression excuse me but why
2 car accidents. A madea bubble built bitch took my mans. depression. fake ass friends.
We are every impressed by the way #eastenders has handled the topic of depression this year. 💔 #MentalHealthMatters Thank you @danboy
I've just slept for almost 12 hours 2 days in a row. This is the 4th day I haven't left my house. I want to feel normal again. #depression
People who suffer from depression aren't thinking rationally so they see absolutely no other way out
Hope @danboy is nominated for an award at next years BSA's he has been phenomenal during Lee's depression storyline🙌👏 #MentalHealthMatters
he was brilliant great portrayel of depression had me crying as i suffer myself & been suicidal 👏👏👏☺☺
go faire une depression
depression cherry
Great scenes tonight @danboy, you've portrayed this depression storyline very well! #Eastenders
Not having enough sex can put you at risk of anxiety paranoia and depression.
I guess not, once again she said that I obviously don't know what real depression is
Cops with depression
the depression is stronk today :') I have a lot of pre work anxiety
Im going through some meat depression right now
c-clinical depression?
Zero in more on the shogi matches and Rei's depression. Fewer slice-of-life cooking shenanigans from other characters.
Eastenders doing a lot of  justice regarding depression and mental health in men .
'Father.' He really was upset with himself for letting Bruce's depression get this far.
I suffered from pneumonia and it wasnt half as crippling as when I've been at my worst with depression. #Eastenders did a great job tonight.
Optimist people are not just cheerful people, they have better relationships and have to deal with less anxiety, stress & depression.
will have taught people that people with depression r not faking it for attention or anything ridiculous like that but they're ill
Some advice would be helpful... Or some clarification - am I suffering from depression?
you actually described why ppl move from serious anxiety episodes to extreme depression. Survival response.
I pressed shuffle and Marilyn Monroe comes on, made my fucking day and saved me from depression
If your suffering with depression don't watch @bbceastenders #eastenders is the most depressing soap on tv!
yes me too! And Lee with his depression. Shows it can happen to anyone and most importantly, not just women!!
absolutely sobbing that eastenders is tackling depression and self-harm with men
$600 fix to my car 😔depression mode activated
I struggled with a lot of depression and anxiety this semester so I'm proud of my 3.1 GPA!
Well done #EastEnders for bringing depression/ mental health into public eye. A realistic, well acted story that will hopefully help someone
make depression your prisoner. Don't let it be your master
When you slip back into depression, and can't find a ladder to climb back out
Thanks for making me forget about my depression and anxiety for a few minutes everyday. Love your videos! Keep doing good!💚
Brill portrayal into showing how hard it is to live with #depression brought a tear too my eye as I know that feeling to well @bbceastenders
well done to Eastenders for doing a story on depression, especially in men, ppl suffer & hide it, the best way is honestly talking about it
Linked a few people that suffer from depression this year & I realised its not a joke or a fake illness
As someone who has depression it really upsets me when uneducated people write nasty comments mental health. Hopefully @danboy doing this...
After watching #eastenders i now have depression ☹️
there was a helpline number for depression afterwards-I'm not sure if that is normal with the programme but Christ it's depressing
I find interesting that you feel the need to claim the whole world is angry to control your depression. Get over it. She lost. He won.
yes it does, I struggled with depression and anxiety and still do now after massive break down 👎 #MentalHealthMatters
Hard viewing that eastenders tonight!! #depression
just got diagnosed ! i have clinical depression 😜👊
Reminder: telling people with anxiety and depression that it's "all in your head" is like telling an asthmatic it's "all in your lungs".
Well done to #Eastenders on their #depression storyline 👏👏👏
Wow, another worthy episode. A real feeling episode.  So many issues all linked with depression. But a positive end #hope ✨
the worst of them being my depression and knee disorder
.zy do they call it a happy meal if it tastes like a wh|le lot like depression.
Poor Lee. Acting aside, mental health is something that needs to be spoken about more. Especially male depression. #Eastenders #MentalHealth
amazingly well by @danboy he should be so proud! I'm genuinely moved I've got aniexty + depression and its shit :) x #MentalHealthMatters
The depression symptoms have stopped but now the anxiety symptoms are kicking in!
Brilliant scenes tonight @danboy @bbceastenders I really hope they change some people's opinions about depression
When oddly melancholic music plays at the end of Eastenders...😢 #addiction #alcoholism #depression all in @BBCOne @bbceastenders tonight
Well done #EastEnders for tackling a really important subject - depression in men. Really moving performance from @danboy - great job 👏
Favorite travel games in 2016: Is it jetlag or depression? And Is it jetlag or anxiety/insomnia?
thanks. I feel like it's not coming back though, my depression passed about 2 weeks ago and I still don't care
well done for highlighting male depression, very well done indeed 😐
I'd like to argue that attractive men with puppies could cure depression
depression is a real mental health 🙄 obviously and yes he is a strong actor
90s cartoons and crippling depression.
RT "RT Parveen_Comms: Anyone suffering from depression should get help. I know it's easy for me to say, but there are people out there who …
Really impressed with Eastenders trying to bring attention to male depression. Over 70% of suicides in the UK are male, it's unacceptable.
Your crippling depression is showing
Absolutely amazing performance by @danboy tonight on #Eastenders shining a light on the powerful issue of men's depression. Fantastic sir!
So glad @bbceastenders didn't kill Lee off but instead gave his character the strength to seek help for his depression. Amazing ep! @danboy
Thought Eastenders was brilliant- Mental illness/depression is such an awful thing and hopefully people's eyes have been opened #eastenders
Well done to #eastenders for the very powerful depression storyline. Great acting! Please talk things out guys-#itsoktotalk
Guess what time is it? Its depression o'clock
Credit eight years of sound economic policies -from depression to a roaring end. Now we must face a Hoover on steroids. Bad end.
i LOVE depression ! my BEST friend
Poor Lee. Acting aside, ALL mental health needs to be spoken about more. Especially male depression. #eastenders #speakout #mentalhealth
Eastenders don't half know how to get that seasonal depression in motion
I have crypling depression
Yes I am feeling emotionally destressed after that overload of depression. Do they do it to make us realise how fortunate we are? #enders
i feel really ill      in like a panickihg depression way ??????
time to try to make my depression go away by sleeping in the middle of the day!!! it's never worked before but another try can't hurt!!
my hopes for my depression disentergrating like my will for existance.
Post-con depression pls.
.@thebandGHOST both cured and caused my depression
Gratitude reduces the risk of anxiety & depression. #iammentallyaware #iambipolar
Place always looks a little bare & lonely after Christmas. Wonder if the stats on depression increase after Christmas?
I'm glad Lee's 'young male' depression storyline finally went somewhere past the audience hating him. This topic deserved better #EastEnders
Nothing makes me forget about my depression more than watching @Zak_Bagans honestly makes me believe in the unbelievable 👊anythings possible
the only threesome i've ever had was with anxiety and depression
I just saw a road sign that said debt and depression real big and i though i was about college
@danboy Don't think I've ever seen depression so accurately and beautifully depicted. Moving beyond words.

So happy to see that Eastenders are highlighting depression in men, a huge step towards breaking the stigma in mental health 👏🏻
i need anti depression pills or some shit cause im like mentally breaking down so often now
having depression literally destroys your life
I treat my depression when I look at #donaldtrump and #putin pictures in my bedroom
summary: 2016 have been one of the worst and most eventful year in my life. my "depression" (i'm not diagnosed cause i'm afraid to test me)>
Holy shit. My depression just like sky rocketed for no reason?????? Sweet. Love it.
#leecarter in #eastenders got me crying at his acting. Well done @danboy for your take on depression and how isolating it can be 👏🏻
Very powerful episode of @bbceastenders tonight, great performance by @danboy #eastenders #depression #awareness #SalvationArmy
me: sleeps 14-16 hours/day my depression: "bitch, thought you'd seen the last of me"
Some days my bed wins and I'm ok with it #chronicpain #depression
Great performance from 'Lee on tonight's #eastenders portraying a man at the edge of his depression.
my belief in #projectlg have been a life guard for two friends going through depression while battling my own we can beat this
Just been told I don't understand depression.Why judge me?? You don't know I had 3 breakdowns in the 80's.. TOSSER!! #eastenders
Would be lovely if depression could 'just end' it's an important storyline about a serious issue
@bbceastenders really sensitive portrail of depression so many young men stay silent out of fear of not being "real" men #dontbesilent
Depression is not a 'bit of a slump' after an extended period of joy, depression doesn't come with the joy. Be smarter.
Well done @bbceastenders on depression storyline. Very well handled, shame @danboy is leaving. has done a great job
Very emotional episode of Eastenders.watching lee carter suffering from depression good acting from tfe actor who plays him
Wow @bbceastenders did an amazing job on telling the story of male depression & #mentalhealth well done #Eastenders
I don't have anxiety. I don't have depression. I'm just really sad.
I gave up on my diet after 3 days and honestly I'm not even ashamed of myself.  Y'all crazy for eating the epitome of depression on a plate.
#Eastenders is phenomenal tonight. Moved me to tears. Raising awareness of mental health & depression is so important. Well done @danboy 👏🏻
U know it's super hard for someone to open up about having depression or anxiety
I will leave you to your cesspool of depression and despair. 😘
#eastenders  brilliant storyline about male depression. Hopefully it'll help some guys stop suffering in silence. Well done all 👍
Them: "I'm sorry you have [OCD], but depression is worse."  Me: *nods politely, refrains from mentioning the psych hold*
Thank God for yoga. Yoga has helped so much with depression and anxiety.

Damian watched Tim disappear down the driveway. He felt the dark void of guilt and depression set in. @RedRobin_3
Props to the scriptwriters too. Nuanced, sensitive portrayal of depression x poverty x toxic gender roles. #Eastenders
My depression and anxiety understand that when we have political differences but they can't really get, "Yeah, I just don't like her."
Outstanding acting from @danboy tonight, as a depression sufferer it's being played out perfectly in my eyes👀❤
@danboy Amazing acting showing depression can be harmful and hurt people.
Poor lee breaking my heart😢depression is a serious illness and @danboy and @bbceastenders have done it so well
I would come on, but I'm in bed with crippling depression

'2016 was the worst year ever'  WW1, WW2, The great depression.  I can carry on...?
glad he didn't jump, the car park lady would need therapy after that.  Well done Eastenders for covering #suicide #depression
Massive respect to @danboy for doing such a great job on this very important storyline about depression and male suicide #EastEnders
My parents both suffered from depression. After I was born.
Lee storyline shows how depression can build and the resultant thoughts completely cloud reality. #eastenders
I'm almost caught up with part 8, and I'm pretty sure that once I am I'll just slip into unrelenting depression.
Lee is absolutely breaking my heart omg, this is so sad to watch, I don't think people realise how much depression affects and takes over
Going through severe depression last year was probably one of the best things that could have happened to me. It woke me up. (cont.)
i may suffer from "anxiety" and "Depression" but i'm still a queen
This is how suicide, depression, dropping out of school and permanent damage to someone's life happens.
god forbid you have to deal with depression one day & your doctor snores on you. Hun.
For all the people tweeting 'jump you cunt' to Lee, I really pray you don't suffer from depression you evil shits.  😡 #eastenders
Some first rate scriptwriting in #eastenders for once. Highlighting depression in young men. Well done lads  at the @BBC
I find watching stuff when someone shows depression and suicide hard , it personally hits me @danboy portrays it all brilliantly 🙌🏻
I'd say well done to @bbceastenders for tackling male depression/suicide. Lee's storyline is reality for many men. #EastEnders
As someone who has has and does suffer with depression I can say people who have not suffered with it will never fully understand it.
"Mess"?You mean how he brought us back from the brink of economic depression?The man kicked ass.
#EASTENDERS That was amazing-as someone who has suffered from depression it portryed it perfectly. If only there was someone there for evey1
mitsuchizu is your worst kind of depression because the mao figure OwO but u gotta trust me w ur addresso
As someone who's been there, done that and got the depression postcard, I wasn't convinced. 'Karen' read a Samaritans guidebook. #EastEnders
People judge too easy. You dont understand depression then just be quiet. Dont be mean about it #eastenders
#eastenders How sad for Lee. I'd like to see the 'man up' and 'jump' brigade go through depression, might change their opinion.
The amount of people on Twitter who think Lee's depression and suicide is a laughing matter shock me. #EastEnders
Well done to #eastenders for how they're handling Lee's depression and suicide storyline 💝
#eastenders Am in bits over Lee's storyline about depression, amazing acting and very hard hitting. @danboy can't praise you enough for it.
#eastenders  highlighting depression in today's episode. Poor Lee.
#Eastenders is extremely emotional tonight. Poor Lee suffering from depression, affects so many people every single day! @bbceastenders
To be fair, I don't really think the issue of male depression/suicide is unrealistic
deleting my tumblr & moving out of my hometown cured my depression
Danny Boy Hatchard's acting is off the scale tonight! I'm crying along with Lee! 😢 #Eastenders have done an amazing portrayal of depression.
well 1929 started the great depression of America sure that doesnt compare to the Great Bitching of America 2016
Sobbing my eyes out at #eastenders depression is a horrible thing for anyone to go through,heartbreaking feeling that you're all alone 💔😥💔
she's being treated different because of her "depression" and she refuses to do any press
@danboy deserves a freckin' oscar right now..!!!!!!! Amazing portrayal of depression & how it affects people 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Hearts breaking for Lee on Eastenders💔 This is why mental health needs to be maken more seriously, depression can kill.
Such a good story line for Lee #eastenders #depression
Fair play to #EastEnders tackling the issue of depression in young men, it really isn't talked about enough.
Depression is telling me quit job heal self anxiety is telling me no bitch u could never go thru another job interview ever again
Lee Carter's performance was heartbreaking. Shows how depression can affect anyone, even those from 'perfect' families. #eastenders
Yes because when I'm blonde it shows my crippling depression
EastEnders depression storyline is important but I can't take a straight white man saying he wishes he was gay because it would be easier? 🙈
Poweful stuff tonite. Hope it opens people eyes to depression and how painful it can be.  #eastenders
@danboy is doing a shit job of portraying someone with depression. Coming across a lot more like a complete wet flannel. #eastenders
Respect to #eastenders for recognising depression in a normal working class male. Been there, lost 'friends'.  Difficult to watch.
Living in a psuedo-depression made up of memes doesn't sound too bad...
I understand depression and mental illness i have battled mental health issues, this lee stuff is awfully done #eastenders
writing mitsuchizu was the worst kind of depression because the mao figure is sold out
*has crippling depression and tries to lighten it up by streaming
don't like #Eastenders I can partly relate to this depression story, Hard to fit in anywhere if your starting from scratch like I've had to.
Like I'm glad none of my friends actually got depression cause they probably would've took they own life listening to the rest of the group
This script is a bit clunky. "Yes depression is a big problem among young men, Lee, that's why we're doing this storyline." #eastenders
Fair play to eastenders for highlighting depression in men
depression
I don't want to work... ahhh. Ugh.... let me sleep for a few years.. depression is.. taking me... nooooooo
Omg depression is awful. And feeling like there's no way out. I've been there. Come on Lee, .. @bbceastenders this is so hard to watch  😭😭😭
But depression is the reality? What do
Thing is I wish #eastenders focused more on the developments of Lee's depression to make more people aware of the issues that come with it
#FF @JoEllenNotte for interesting posts about #sex #depression #sextoys & more!
@bbceastenders scariest thing in the world is your loved one suffering from depression thanks for this storyline
(2/2) Get better. I had depression and anxiety myself. It is zero fun. But it does make us stronger, but I hope you best.
Alot of you are so heartless  If someone close to you suffers from depression you gonna go tell them to jump aswell?  #eastenders
@danboy acting is amazing in #eastenders depression is a horrible thing, and he is playing this amazingly 🙌🏼
Well done @bbceastenders on tackling depression and suicide in men. Needs to be talked about more.
Leave that idea that anxiety and depression can be easily controlled! Leave that idea with all the other bs ideas in 2016
Now it turns out to be described in a series of tall depression?
The issue with eastenders is they make a proper storyline like depression and have to throw in the stealing bullshit #eastenders
Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression
This is how bad depression can be and killing your self is not the answer. Think of your family and friends!  #eastenders
What a job Eastenders are doing on this depression storyline. Still a huge stigma around mental illness in men and we must talk about that.
Hats off to @bbceastenders and @danboy for their amazing story line and acting covering depression!
Well done @bbceastenders on such a moving and accurate portrayal of depression
It took depression to open my eyes
People saying lee should man up & stop self pitying ffs depression is a real thing & DOES happen to men, it's a serious illness #EastEnders
@danboy I suffer from depression and you are capturing it so well xx
My Heart's breaking for Lee. I know what depression is like @bbceastenders #eastenders
How was Lee in the army? I know depression can do A LOT but his character is so generally weak.   #EastEnders
@bbceastenders touching scenes on the roof top. Really well done and touched me. Well done @danboy great job showing how tough depression is
Keep poisoning your mind with negative thoughts then wonder why your depression doesnt go away #SumPeepulTwoStoopid
it is good that they are raising awareness of depression in men!
I wish Eastenders just focused on Lee's depression rather than turning him into a criminal
The woman with Lee is doing a brilliant job with supporting him through his depression #EastEnders
Tbh I can relate to what Lee is saying, depression is horrible :( #eastenders
ure gonna get depression if u don accept reality 😉
@danboy bringing so much awareness to depression in #EastEnders it's heartbreaking, if it only helps one person that's a breakthrough!
he's got depression? It doesn't work like that lol dick
This ep of @bbceastenders is heartbreaking 💔but so good. Shows the real side of depression and super stuff @danboy
ppl are fucking disgusting tweeting "jump" i pray to god your family/friends never come to you about depression. #EastEnders
ure gonna get depression if u don accpet reality 😉
the storyline on easterners about lee's depression has me in tears
You know, I'd feel for Lee if he wasn't incredibly unlikable. I have clinical depression, I don't steal from my family #eastenders
what does anxiety + depression feel like
Wonderful performance by @danboy depression and suicide in young men is often ignored well done to @bbceastenders for this storyline. ❤
Lee mate let me tell you first hand being gay doesn't make crippling depression easier to deal with #eastenders
The "my love life sucks" NYE depression is starting to hit me pretty hard. I had hopes I could avoid this.
Am I just lazy or is my depression causing me to be constantly tired and unmotivated: the saga
if they had auctually focused on Lee just with his depression this story would have worked. turning him into a criminal didint #eastenders
My father is in depression. [As far as I can think of
